### 1. Backend (Node.js + Express.js)

- Use **Puppeteer** (for JavaScript-rendered pages) to scrape Amazon product details.
- Store the extracted data in **MongoDB**.
- Implement an API endpoint (`/scrape`) to trigger the scraper.

### 2. Frontend (React.js)

- Create a UI to input the Amazon product link.
- Display scraped product details (name, price, images, offers, etc.).
- Show an AI-generated summary of customer reviews using **Gemini API**, instead of OpenAI, as **OpenAI does not offer a free tier**.

### 3. Database (MongoDB)

Store scraped product data for future reference.

Tech Stack:

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Puppeteer/Cheerio
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
